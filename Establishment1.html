        <h2>Establishment</h2>
        <p> The institute was established in 1981 by the Dattajirao Kadam Education Society under the guidance of K.B. Awade, a former MP. DKTE was founded to cater to the educational and industrial needs of the textile sector in Ichalkaranji, which is known as the "Manchester of Maharashtra" due to its thriving textile industry. The institute was established by the Deccan Education Society of Ichalkaranji to create a talent pool of skilled professionals who could support and innovate within the textile industry.</p>
